## Hi there 👋

I'm Thibault, based in the most beautiful city of Europe (Bruges) and working at In The Pocket as an Engineering Lead.
My previous technical strength lies in React Native, React, Next, Node and Linux.

I now try to be the software engineer that can act as manager, instead of the manager that used to software engineer.
